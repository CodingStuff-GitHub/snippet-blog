### Prompts for Different Purposes

Recall that a large language model, or LLM, is an AI model trained on vast amounts of text to identify patterns between words, concepts, and phrases. Good prompt engineering can guide an LLM to generate useful output for workplace tasks. This reading explores how to write clear and specific prompts for various workplace use cases.

**Use Cases:**
You might utilize an LLM at work to boost productivity and creativity, completing tasks such as:
- Content creation
- Summarization
- Classification
- Extraction
- Translation
- Editing
- Problem-solving

*Note:* The examples provided illustrate best practices; they're not exact templates for every situation. Results may vary based on the specific LLM used. Always critically evaluate LLM output and iterate on prompts for optimal results.

**Effective Prompting:**
- Consider what you want the LLM to produce. Include specific instructions like create, summarize, classify, extract, translate, edit, or solve.
- Provide necessary context and detailed instructions regarding the style or format of the desired output.

### Examples for Each Use Case

**Content Creation:**
An LLM can assist in generating content for various purposes. For instance:
- Task: Develop a concise tagline for a washing machine emphasizing its features.
- Prompt Structure: Describe the LLM's role and specify the tagline requirements.

**Summarization:**
LLMs excel at summarizing various texts. For example:
- Task: Summarize the main points of a lengthy email in a bulleted list.
- Prompt Structure: Provide context, specify the summarization format, and include the relevant text.

**Classification:**
LLMs aid in text classification tasks. For instance:
- Task: Analyze the sentiment of customer reviews.
- Prompt Structure: Clearly state the task and options (positive, negative, or neutral), and include relevant reviews.

**Extraction:**
LLMs can extract data from text. For example:
- Task: Extract references to clothing items and their prices from a blog post.
- Prompt Structure: Clearly state the extraction task and desired output format.

**Translation:**
LLMs facilitate quick text translation. For example:
- Task: Translate product descriptions from English to Spanish while maintaining tone and structure.
- Prompt Structure: Specify the translation task and provide examples with clear labels.

**Editing:**
LLMs assist in editing and rewriting text. For example:
- Task: Simplify a technical report for a general audience.
- Prompt Structure: Clearly state the editing task and desired changes while maintaining the main ideas.

**Problem-solving:**
LLMs can generate solutions for various workplace challenges. For example:
- Task: Organize a gardening program for children, including plant selection.
- Prompt Structure: Provide context, break down the problem into steps, and specify requirements.

*Pro Tip:* Break down problems into steps to improve LLM processing and output accuracy.

# Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique used to guide large language models (LLMs) through step-by-step reasoning processes. This technique breaks down tasks into manageable steps, improving the accuracy and consistency of LLM outputs.

## Benefits
- Enhances the accuracy of LLM outputs by dividing tasks into steps.
- Facilitates understanding of intermediate steps, aiding in error detection and evaluation.

## Applications
- Useful for mathematical or logical reasoning tasks such as budget management, data analysis, and product recommendation.

## Prompt Design
- Chain-of-thought prompts typically include examples demonstrating step-by-step problem-solving.
- Examples should provide context, demonstrate the process, and state specific requests for the LLM's response.

## Example Prompt
### Context
- Describes the problem and provides instructions for solving it step-by-step.

### Example
- Presents a question-answer pair illustrating the problem-solving process.

### Request
- States a specific question for the LLM to answer, following the example provided.
